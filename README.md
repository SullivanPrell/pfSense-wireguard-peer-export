One click to add a peer, get the `.conf` file, and generate a QR code. No more configuring both sides manually.

Adding a WireGuard peer on pfSense normally means: create the peer in the GUI, manually generate keys, copy the public key back, hand-craft the client config, and figure out the endpoint/subnet yourself. This plugin turns all of that into a single step — click **Add New Peer**, fill in a name, and you get a ready-to-use config file and QR code while the peer is automatically registered on the firewall.

## What's New in v1.1.0

### 🩺 Peer Connectivity Doctor
A per-peer diagnostic engine that walks the full connectivity chain and reports each link as pass / warn / fail with a concrete fix. Click the stethoscope icon on any peer row to run it. Checks, in causal order:

1. **Peer enabled** — peer is active in the configuration
2. **Tunnel state** — tunnel exists, is enabled, and is running in the kernel
3. **Peer loaded in kernel** — detects the classic config-vs-kernel gap where only the `.conf` files were rewritten without a proper tunnel sync
4. **UDP port bound** — verifies the tunnel's listen port actually has a listener (via `sockstat`)
5. **WAN reachability rule** — WAN pass rule or NAT port forward covering the listen port
6. **Tunnel firewall rule** — pass rule on the tunnel interface is present *and* free of the protocol/TCP-flags trap: rules with `protocol = any` combined with TCP flags, or TCP-only rules, are flagged by name with an explanation of why they silently drop all non-TCP peer traffic
7. **Outbound NAT** — mode-aware; automatic/hybrid pass, manual mode scans rules for the tunnel subnet, disabled warns with a fix
8. **Handshake** — never / stale (with age) / fresh (< 3 minutes), with endpoint hint for never-connected peers
9. **Traffic flow** — rx-only or tx-only asymmetry diagnosed separately (one-way traffic is the signature of the rule trap or missing NAT)
10. **Addressing** — peer /32 inside the tunnel subnet; catches duplicate IPs and duplicate public keys across peers on the same tunnel
11. **Path-MTU probe** — DF-set ICMP ladder to the live endpoint (1500 → 1492 → 1472 → 1420); prescribes a concrete MTU and MSS clamp when the path is constrained; reports inconclusive rather than a false alarm when the client blocks ICMP
12. **WebSocket listener** — (WS tunnels only) verifies the TCP WS port has a local listener

The modal shows a colour-coded result for each check and a **Next Step** banner carrying the first failure's remediation so there is no ambiguity about where to start.

### 🗑️ Delete Tunnel
Tunnels can now be deleted directly from the WireGuard Status panel via a trash button in the new Actions column.

- Assigned tunnels (those mapped to a pfSense OPT interface) show a **disabled button** with a tooltip — the assignment must be removed at Interfaces → Assignments first, matching the native package's own validation
- Tunnels with peers require an explicit **cascade confirmation**: click OK to delete the tunnel and all its peers from the kernel and config simultaneously
- A **type-the-tunnel-name prompt** is required in the browser, and the name match is re-enforced server-side — no accidental one-click deletes
- Cascaded peers are removed from the kernel via `wg set … peer … remove` before the config is touched
- WGX-managed outbound NAT rules (`WGX: Auto-created outbound NAT for <tun>`) are cleaned up automatically; manually created rules are left untouched
- Follows all established WGX conventions: CSRF, rate limiting, `config_get_path` / `config_set_path`, audit log, HA sync

### 📊 NOC Dashboard — Subnet Usage Overhaul

**Per-tunnel subnet accounting (backend)**

Previous versions computed IP capacity and usage incorrectly: `used_ips` incremented once per Allowed IPs row across all peers regardless of tunnel, and split-tunnel LAN routes (`192.168.1.0/24`) in the same list were counted as addresses. The backend now:

- Builds a per-tunnel subnet map using a four-tier resolution chain: **kernel** (`pfSense_get_ifaddrs()` / `ifconfig` parse) → **tunnel config** `addresses/row` → **assigned OPT interface** static config → **peer inference** (infers a `/24` from the first peer `/32`, flagged as *inferred*)
- Uses kernel-first resolution because the native package leaves `addresses/row` empty for assigned tunnels (it seeds them with a blank row with mask 128)
- Counts a peer once, only if its IPv4 address falls inside its own tunnel's subnet via a net-long mask compare
- Handles case-insensitive tunnel name matching between config and peer records

**Precise percentage display**

`Math.round(2/506×100)` was producing `0%` used and `100%` available for a lightly-used pool. The display now:

- Uses `fmtPctPrecise()`: never rounds nonzero use down to `0%` or a non-full pool up to `100%`; clamps to `<0.1%` / `>99.9%` at the extremes; one decimal below 10%
- Shows a **doughnut centre readout** (`2 / 506` + `0.4% used`) via an inline Chart.js plugin so the count and percentage can never contradict each other
- **Filter-aware scoping**: selecting a tunnel in the Tunnel dropdown re-scopes the pie to that tunnel's `used / capacity` — the meaningful numbers for the subnet peers actually live in — with the tunnel name and CIDR labelled in the heading

**New panels in Charts Row 3**

- **Subnet Utilisation by Tunnel** — table with per-tunnel CIDR, progress bars (green / amber at 70% / red at 90%), precise % label, and a hover tooltip showing which resolution tier found the subnet (`kernel`, `tunnel-config`, `pfsense-interface`, `inferred`, or `unresolved`); inferred entries are marked `*`
- **Top Talkers (24h)** — top 5 peers ranked by 24-hour traffic, computed server-side from the telemetry archive with reset-aware delta calculation (counter reset → use the new value as the delta); medal emojis for top 3
- **Country Distribution** — peer country chips from the existing geo cache

---

## ✨ Full Feature List

- **Visual Telemetry & NOC Dashboard:** A dedicated Network Operations Center (NOC) dashboard featuring live Rx/Tx bandwidth charts, IP subnet exhaustion pie charts with per-tunnel breakdown, a 24-hour aggregated usage trend chart, a live Top Talkers table, and a country distribution panel.

- **Peer Connectivity Doctor:** Per-peer 12-check diagnostic modal covering the full chain from config through kernel, port binding, firewall rules (including the protocol/TCP-flags trap), NAT, handshake, traffic symmetry, addressing conflicts, path-MTU, and WebSocket listener. Each check provides a plain-English result and a concrete remediation step.

- **Delete Tunnel:** Remove tunnels (and optionally cascade-delete their peers) directly from the WireGuard Status panel, with assignment guard, typed-name confirmation, kernel teardown, NAT cleanup, and HA sync.

- **Auto-Tunnel Setup Wizard:** Deploy entirely new WireGuard tunnels from scratch in seconds. It automatically handles key generation, interface mapping, firewall rules, and Outbound NAT.

- **One-Click Peer Provisioning:** Instantly creates the peer on the firewall, generates keys, and delivers a ready-to-import `.conf` + QR code.

- **Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6 Support:** The Auto-Setup Wizard fully supports IPv6 — create IPv6-only tunnels or dual-stack tunnels with both primary and secondary IP addresses.

- **Smart IP Allocation & Conflict Prevention:** The auto-IP engine uses a proper free-list allocator that scans the tunnel subnet to find the first genuinely free IP address, filling gaps left by deleted peers. Proactively blocks provisioning on IP conflict.

- **Import `.conf` Files:** Upload an existing WireGuard configuration file and the UI automatically parses keys, IPs, and endpoints to pre-fill the provisioning modal.

- **Expiration, Identity Sync & Telemetry Daemon:** A background cron job automatically disables peers at their expiration date, syncs with LDAP/Local User accounts (`ad_sync:` prefix) to revoke VPN access when accounts are disabled, and archives bandwidth telemetry for the dashboard.

- **Auto-Update Checker:** A background checker (Daily, Weekly, or Never) alerts you to new versions with a one-click Download & Install Now banner.

- **Advanced Peer Management:** Key Rotation (revoke + fresh keypair), Kill Connection (instant kernel drop), and Delete Peer — all from the peer row action buttons.

- **Email Configuration Delivery:** Email `.conf` files directly to end-users via the native pfSense SMTP engine.

- **Bulk CSV Import:** Mass-provision peers by pasting a list of names and IP addresses into the Bulk CSV modal.

- **Global Security Policies:** Enforce mandatory Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) for all new peers and configure fallback subnets for split tunnelling.

- **Resilient HA Sync Wizard:** Push peers to a backup node over XMLRPC with a Strict TLS toggle. Failed sync attempts are queued and retried automatically by the daemon.

- **Self-Healing & Persistence:** Auto-Bootstrap persistence survives pfSense firmware upgrades, pre-install backups protect config during updates, and aggressive UI tab healing keeps native menus intact.

- **100% Offline Assets:** Locally installed JavaScript libraries for QR codes and charts with built-in dependency validation — no external CDN calls.

- **Namespace Isolation (Bulletproof Uninstalls):** All custom UI files and tools are sandboxed in a dedicated `/wgx/` directory rather than injected into the native WireGuard folders — uninstalling is 100% safe and never breaks the native pfSense WireGuard GUI.

- **Automated Bandwidth Throttling (QoS Alias):** The telemetry daemon monitors total data usage per peer. Peers exceeding a configured soft cap are placed into a dynamic `WGX_THROTTLED` pfSense Alias for use with traffic shapers or block rules.

- **Time-Based Access Scheduling:** Restrict peer access to configured time windows (e.g. Business Hours, Weekends Only), enforced by the expiration daemon.

- **FRR OSPF Dynamic Routing Injection:** Automatically inject new tunnel interfaces into the pfSense FRR OSPF package during setup to broadcast routes across a mesh network.

- **Dedicated System Audit Trail:** The Audit tab filters native pfSense system logs to provide a searchable history of all WG Suite actions — peer creations, deletions, key rotations, S2S deployments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build from source

This fork does not publish binaries. You build the package yourself from the
source in `src/`, so what you install is what you can read. `build.py` uses
only the Python standard library, so this works on macOS and Linux as well as
FreeBSD.

**1. Build the package**
```bash
make build
```

**2. Confirm the package matches the source tree**
```bash
make verify
```

**3. Copy it to the firewall**
```bash
scp dist/pfSense-pkg-wg-export-1.1.0.pkg root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
```

**4. Install it** — SSH into pfSense (option 8 for a shell) and run:
```bash
pkg add -fM /tmp/pfSense-pkg-wg-export-1.1.0.pkg
```

Builds are byte-reproducible, so two people building the same commit get the
same `sha256`. Check yours against anyone else's before trusting a package you
did not build.

### Uninstall

```bash
pkg delete pfSense-pkg-wg-export
```

### If you have ever installed upstream 1.0.8 or 1.0.9

Those releases write a root command into `config.xml` that re-installs a
package from a third-party URL at every boot, and it survives pfSense
upgrades. Installing this fork does **not** remove it. Check for it:

```bash
sh audit.sh
```

Section 6 reports it and gives removal instructions. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#2-critical-remote-controlled-auto-installer-in-108-and-109).

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Deploy a New Tunnel

1. Go to **VPN > WG Suite > Setup**
2. Enter a **Tunnel Description** (e.g. `Employee_VPN`) and a **Listen Port** (default: `51820`)
3. Enter your **Tunnel IPv4 Address / CIDR** (e.g. `10.10.10.1/24`)
4. _(Optional)_ Enter an **IPv6 Address / Prefix** for a dual-stack tunnel
5. Select your **Outbound NAT Interface** (usually WAN)
6. Click **Deploy Tunnel**

The suite automatically generates server keys, creates the interface, assigns IP addresses, builds firewall rules, and creates outbound NAT rules. The tunnel is immediately ready for peers.

### 2. Add a New Peer

1. Go to **VPN > WG Suite > Export**, click **Add Peer** (or **Import .conf**)
2. Pick a **Target Tunnel** — Endpoint, Public Key, and AllowedIPs fill in automatically
3. Enter a **Peer Description** (becomes the config filename)
4. **Auto-IP Discovery** calculates and suggests the next available IP in the tunnel subnet
5. Optionally set **DNS**, **Pre-Shared Key**, **Expiration (Days)**, or **Split Tunnel** mode
6. Download the `.conf` or scan the QR code
7. Click **Provision & Save**

> ⚠️ Download or scan before clicking Save — the private key is generated statelessly and wiped from memory once saved.

### 3. Diagnose a Peer

Click the **stethoscope icon** (🩺) on any peer row to open the Connectivity Doctor. The modal runs all 12 checks against the live system and returns within a few seconds (the path-MTU probe accounts for most of the time). Each failed or warned check shows a concrete fix. Click **Run again** to re-check after making a change.

### 4. Delete a Tunnel

Click the **trash icon** in the Actions column of the WireGuard Status panel. Assigned tunnels show a disabled button — unassign first at **Interfaces > Assignments**. Tunnels with peers prompt for cascade confirmation, then require you to type the tunnel name before the request is sent.

### 5. Export Existing Peers & Live Management

The peer list shows tunnel, public key, allowed IPs, live status, and Rx/Tx usage.

- **Export:** QR code icon → generate config
- **Email:** envelope icon → send via pfSense SMTP
- **Rotate Keys:** refresh icon → revoke and re-key
- **Bandwidth Graph:** bar-chart icon → per-peer 24h graph
- **Kill Connection:** bolt icon → instant kernel drop
- **Connectivity Doctor:** stethoscope icon → 12-check diagnostic
- **Delete:** trash icon → permanent removal
- **Bulk Download:** Download All → archive of every peer's config

## 🔒 Security & Architecture

- **100% Offline & Air-Gap Safe:** All frontend libraries are installed locally — no external CDN calls from the WebGUI
- **Hardened Admin Verification:** Authentication strictly queries the pfSense native system configuration for `admins` group membership
- **Strict CSRF Protection:** All background interactions use pfSense native tokens
- **Server-Side Validation:** Inputs sanitised server-side; IP conflicts blocked before writing to config
- **Stateless Key Management:** Private keys are generated by the firewall's `wg` binary, sent directly to the browser, and never stored in the pfSense config or system logs
- **Typed-Name Confirmation:** Destructive operations (tunnel deletion) require the name to be typed in the browser and re-verified server-side
- **Global Security Toggles:** Optional strict PSK enforcement and strict TLS validation on HA sync to prevent MITM attacks
- **Rate Limiting:** All AJAX endpoints are rate-limited; returning HTTP 429 on excess
- **Audit Logging:** All destructive and provisioning actions are written to the pfSense system log and the WG Suite audit trail

## Changelog

### v1.1.0

#### Peer & Tunnel Management
- **NEW** Peer Connectivity Doctor — 12-check per-peer diagnostic (config → kernel → port → WAN rule → tunnel firewall rule → NAT → handshake → traffic symmetry → addressing → path-MTU → WS listener) with a plain-English result and concrete fix for each link. The tunnel firewall check specifically detects the protocol/TCP-flags trap that silently drops all non-TCP peer traffic.
- **NEW** Delete Tunnel — trash button in the WireGuard Status Actions column. Assigned tunnels show a disabled button until unassigned at Interfaces → Assignments. Tunnels with peers require explicit cascade confirmation; kernel peer removal, interface teardown, and WGX outbound NAT cleanup all happen automatically. Typed-name confirmation enforced in both browser and server.

#### NOC Dashboard — Subnet Usage
- **FIXED** Subnet usage accounting — per-tunnel subnet map with four-tier kernel-first resolution (kernel `pfSense_get_ifaddrs()` → tunnel config `addresses/row` → assigned OPT interface → peer inference). Split-tunnel LAN routes in Allowed IPs no longer inflate the used count; each peer is counted once against its own tunnel's subnet only.
- **FIXED** Percentage display — `fmtPctPrecise()` replaces `Math.round()`, eliminating `0% used / 100% available` on lightly loaded pools. Doughnut centre readout shows exact `used / capacity` alongside the percentage so the two can never contradict. Filter-aware pie scoping: selecting a tunnel in the dropdown shows that tunnel's `used / capacity` rather than the aggregate.
- **NEW** NOC Dashboard: Subnet Utilisation by Tunnel table — per-tunnel CIDR, progress bars (green / amber at 70% / red at 90%), precise percentage label, and a hover tooltip showing which resolution tier resolved the subnet (`kernel`, `tunnel-config`, `pfsense-interface`, `inferred`, or `unresolved`).
- **NEW** NOC Dashboard: Top Talkers (24h) — top 5 peers by traffic, computed server-side from the telemetry archive with reset-aware delta calculation. Medal icons for the top three.
- **NEW** NOC Dashboard: Country Distribution — peer country chips from the geo cache.

#### Peer Location Map *(removed in this fork — see SECURITY.md)*
- **NEW** Live world map (OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet.js, loaded locally) showing a marker for every peer that has a recorded endpoint IP. Clicking a marker opens a popup with the peer name, tunnel, last-seen time, and a GPS link so admins can quickly query connections from unexpected locations.
- Markers reflect where each peer's traffic *enters* the internet, not the peer's physical device location: peers on mobile data show their carrier's regional gateway IP; peers on home WiFi show the household WAN IP (because they share the home internet connection). The popup makes this distinction clear so admins interpret the map correctly.
- Admin GPS links open the coordinates in the system default mapping app for quick cross-reference against known peer locations.

#### WebSocket Transport (Advanced) *(removed in this fork — see SECURITY.md)*
- **NEW** WireGuard UDP over WebSocket — tunnels WireGuard traffic inside a standard WebSocket connection on TCP port 443, making it indistinguishable from HTTPS to deep-packet inspection. Defeats networks and firewalls that block UDP, block non-HTTP ports, or actively identify and drop WireGuard handshakes (common on corporate networks, hotels, carrier-grade NAT, and some countries' national filtering infrastructure).
- Configured per-tunnel in the WG Suite UI; the `wg_ws_server` daemon handles the server-side WebSocket-to-UDP relay. Peers download a WebSocket-aware client bundle instead of a standard `.conf`.
- v1.1.0 hardens the WS bundle download (replaced `form.submit()` with `fetch()` + blob), fixes WireGuard routing loops caused by the tunnel daemon's own TCP connection being captured by `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0` (resolved via host-route pinning in `start.sh`), and adds WebSocket Ping/Pong frame handling for connection keepalive on restrictive middleboxes.

#### Dedicated System Audit Trail
- **NEW** Audit tab in the top navigation — filters the native pfSense system log to show only WG Suite actions: peer provisioning, key rotations, tunnel creation and deletion, S2S deployments, and HA sync events.
- Searchable by peer name, tunnel, or action type. Each entry links to the full syslog line for context. Provides a clean compliance-friendly history without requiring access to the raw system log.
